      <p><strong>1. What is Focus?</strong></p>
      <h1>- Focus is a website that is built for everybody who needs to focus. We provide features such as an aesthetic soundboard, a ToDo manager, and a pomdoro timer. These are all there for people who can't focus or can focus but need such an environment</h1>
      <p><strong>2. What is the Pomodoro Technique?</strong></p>
      <h1>The Pomodoro Technique was mainly built for people to focus. It involves dividing your work time into 25 minutes work time and 5 minutes break time. We need to finish at least one task in the 25 minutes. After each 25 minutes, there is a 5 minute break. This allows you to focus and relax your mind.</h1>
      <p><strong>3. Where do I put my suggestion?</strong></p>
      <h1>You can send any suggesstion to <strong>avaneesh1408@gmail.com</strong>. If you have a problem, you can do the same. I also have it mentioned above in the bar so you can take from there too.</h1>
